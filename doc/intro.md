# Introduction

## Hyperconverged Infrastructure

For a user, hyperconverged infrastructure is a platforms that runs
their machines/services on demand. That is orchestrated in real-time
instead of having somebody put a new computer into the datacenter the
next workday. The user pays not only for the variable resource usage
but also for high availability and storage redundancy.

For operators, this guide provides guidelines to prepare a deployment
that will allow to expand its capacities by simply adding more
machines.

In short, we understand Hyperconverged Infrastructure to be what
people expect in **Cloud Computing**, running on standard
off-the-shelf servers.
